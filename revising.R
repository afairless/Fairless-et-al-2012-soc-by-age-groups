# The fictional data in "altereddata.txt" were modified from the original 
# empirical data used in Fairless et al 2012.
# I am using fictional data instead of the original data because I do not have 
# permission of my co-authors to release the data into the public domain.  
# NOTE:  Because these data are fictional, several important characteristics of
# these data may be different from those of the original data (e.g., interrater
# correlations are probably lower, behaviors may not sum properly)

# Each row is a separate mouse.
# The left-most 3 columns are quasi-independent variables (mouse strain, sex, and age).
# The right-most 5 columns are dependent variables describing behaviors of the
# mice during the Social Approach/Choice Test.

# "To further investigate how the strains differed in their sociability across 
# development, we followed with analyses at each age group. . . . At 19 days of 
# age, 2 Ã— 2 (strain by sex) ANOVAs (conventional and 20% trimmed means) showed 
# that BALB/cJ mice were less sociable than C57BL/6J mice . . . "
